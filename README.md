# Prework study guide webpage

## Description

- My motivation was to complete the prework ready to start the course
- I built it to help me quickly learn the fundamentals of frontend webdev, including HTML, CSS and js
- This project solves the problem of having a study guide which lists skills acquired in sections, as well as suggesting which topic should be looked at next
- I learned the basics of HTML, git version control, CSS and js. Particularly useful was the section on git, which I had not used before.


## Installation

## Usage
Each secttion contains a list of some key facts learned in each section of the prework. A js script chooses a random topic - if the user opens the devconsole they can see the js running via console.log
